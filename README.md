# code.gov - Unlocking the potential of the Federal Government’s software.

## Introduction

[Code.gov](https://code.gov) is a a site that promotes good practices in code development, collaboration, and reuse across the U.S.  Government. Code.gov will provide guidance to help agencies implement the [Federal Source Code Policy](https://sourcecode.cio.gov). It will include an inventory of the government's custom code to promote reuse between agencies. It will also provide tools to help government and the public collaborate on open source projects.

Code.gov is an open source project, so we invite your contributions, be it in the form of code, design, or ideas. 

To learn more about the project, check out this [blog post](https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/08/08/peoples-code).

## Timeline

The development of code.gov is being guided by the requirements of the [Federal Source Code Policy](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/). Including:

* "Within 90 days of the publication date of this policy, the Administration will launch https://www.code.gov, an online collection of tools, best practices, and schemas to help agencies implement this policy.";
    
* "Within 90 days of the publication date of this policy, each agency’s CIO—in consultation with the agency’s CAO—shall develop an agency-wide policy that addresses the requirements of this [document.]";  and

* "Within 120 days of the publication date of this policy, each agency must update—and thereafter keep up to date—its inventory of agency information resources to include an enterprise code inventory that lists custom-developed code for or by the agency after the publication of this policy."
    
A *discovery sprint* is currently underway for code.gov during which we are conducting user interviews and engaging this community in discussions that will inform the site's features and user experience. 

After the discovery sprint, we'll begin building the site. We'll be relying on input from the community and from agencies about what features should be delivered first. And because this site is being developed in the open, you will be able to make contributions and provide feedback here as we go.
