# Tools and Resources

Agencies can use this list to become more fluent in the open source marketplace, practices, and what their peers are doing in this space.

## Source Version Control
There are a number of robust, modern source version control systems available that may be appropriate to meet your agency's needs. When selecting a platform agencies will want to consider a number of factors:
- does it provide the ability to develop in the open?
- does your agency need both private and public repositories and does the platform allow seem less integration between the two?
- is the platform interoperable with the dominant open source standard, Git? Interoperability with Git is crucial to your agency's ability to collaborate with other agencies and the open source community, to avoiding vendor lock-in down the road, and to your ability to cheaply onboard talented technologists.
- if your agency plans robust engagement with the open source community it may want to consider the social features of the platform - does it provide features that will enhance the ability of your agency to promote and share it's code?

Some platforms that agencies may want to take a look at based on their functionality and adoption by the open source community include:
- Github
- Gitlab
- Bitbucket

## Code quality and security
A number of commercial and free tools exist that agencies can optionally use as part of their development and code publication process to dramatically lower the risk that inappropriate or insecure content is released. Increasingly, these utilities can be configured to meet the specific security policies of your agency and can be integrated directly into your agency's developer workflow, scanning code automatically whenever code is committed or pushed for passwords, keys, watchwords, and other potentially sensitive information.  Some tools provide broader capabilities related to coding standards and quality, etc.  In developing it's overall source code strategy, our agency may want to consider integrating these kinds of tools into your developer workflow, requiring their use by vendors in contract language, or using them to assess the quality and security of deliverables prior to accepting receipt.
