  
# Building Your Agency's Open Source Practice
  
[Section 7.1](https://policy.cio.gov/source-code/implementation/) of the Source Code Policy discusses roles and responsibilities at the agency level in meeting the overall requirements of the policy.  Regarding Open Source, it also notes that:

` 
agencies should strengthen internal capacity to efficiently and securely deliver OSS as part of regular operations. Additional information on this topic will be provided on Code.gov.  
`

In order to build this capacity, agencies will need to develop staff expertise in a number of areas, as well as build technical capacity.  The open source practice for the U.S. government is expected to rapidly evolve and become more sophisticated over the next several years, so the advice provided here will also evolve. 


# Establish "open by default" as a top-down mandate.
Agencies and teams often experience churn in establishing their open source practice, with key legal, security, and operational issues undergoing frequent re-litigation and the need for practices to be reviewed on a project by project basis.  Those that have been most successful have started with a strong, top-down mandate to adopt an "open by default" stance with regards to code, mirroring that required under [Project Open Data and M-13-13](https://project-open-data.cio.gov) for data. Such a mandate - emanating from the CIO or equivalent, can have the effect of convening the necessary stakeholders to have a serious conversation to establish clear, repeatable processses and foundational policy. With this foundation, teams have a shared context for further discussion and can iterate on policy and process as the team learns together.


# open source is an interdisciplinary practice.
  - 7.1 - "Agency Officials should also work with the agencyâ€™s public affairs staff, open government staff, web manager or digital strategist, program owners, and other leadership to properly identify, publish, and collaborate with communities on their OSS projects."
  - Invest up-front in creating consistent boilerplate, approval processes across technical, acquisitions, security and comms teams.
- 


# Consult with peer agencies to avoid reinventing the wheel
In the spirit of open source development, agencies can benefit greatly from "forking" eachother's approaches to open source generally and even specific language that has been developed with regards to issues like licensing and contract boilerplate. Complex topics like security, communications, and even how to run a successful hackathon are ripe for collaboration between agencies to share lessons learned and pool limited resources.
