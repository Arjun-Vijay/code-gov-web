  
# Building and Maintaining Open Source Code
  
[Section 7.1](https://policy.cio.gov/source-code/implementation/) of the Source Code Policy discusses roles and responsibilities at the agecny level in meeting the overall requirements of the policy.  Regarding Open Source, it also notes that

` agencies should strengthen internal capacity to efficiently and securely deliver OSS as part of regular operations. Additional information on this topic will be provided on Code.gov.  


In order to build this capacity, agencies will need to develop staff expertise in a number of areas, as well as build technical capacity.  The open source practice for the U.S. government is expected to rapidly evolve and become more sophisticated over the next several years, so the advice and tips provided here will also evolve. 


*** MOST AGENCIES DON'T DEVELOP INTERNALLY

- establish "open by default" as a top-down mandate.
- 
- consult with peer agencies to avoid common pitfalls, reinventing the wheel
  - can we get agencies to agree to be named here?
- open source is an interdisciplinary practice.
  - 7.1 - "Agency Officials should also work with the agencyâ€™s public affairs staff, open government staff, web manager or digital strategist, program owners, and other leadership to properly identify, publish, and collaborate with communities on their OSS projects."
  - Invest up-front in creating consistent boilerplate, approval processes across technical, acquisitions, security and comms teams.
