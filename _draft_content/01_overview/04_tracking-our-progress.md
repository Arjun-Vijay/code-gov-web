#OMB’s Assessment of Agency Progress

Section 7.7 of the Source Code Policy notes that: 

> Progress on agency implementation of this policy will be primarily assessed by OMB through an analysis of each agency’s internal Government repositories, public OSS repositories, and code inventories on Code.gov, as well as data obtained through the quarterly Integrated Data Collection (IDC), quarterly PortfolioStat sessions, the IT Dashboard, and additional mechanisms [..]

As with any policy, OMB's approach to measuring and assessing agency progress in meeting this policy's requirements will evolve over time in response to a number of factors.  But generally the approach can be broken into two categories: analysis of agency repositories and code inventory and cross analysis of that information against overall operational and financial data collected by OMB.

OMB will use this space to provide information about the approach as it evolves and address frequently asked questions from agencies and public.

## Analysis of Each Agency’s Custom Code

OMB will regularly review each agency’s enterprise code inventory to ensure that the agency is satisfying the requirements of the Federal Source Code Policy.  This review will include both the agency’s internal Government repositories and public OSS repositories, and ensure that each agency’s enterprise code inventory is properly reflected on – and easily discoverable through – Code.gov.

## Analysis of Overall Data

OMB and the Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer specifically, collect data on agency operations and finances through a number of existing mechanisms including the quarterly PortfolioStat sessions, the quarterly Integrated Data Collection. Much of this data is available publicly on ITDashboard.gov. OMB will use this data to better understand the overall impact of the source code policy and to draw insights about individual agencies.
