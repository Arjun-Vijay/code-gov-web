# Configuration of code-gov-web
code-gov-web is configurable.  You can customize the styling, content and much more.  This document is a work in progress and we will continue to add to it.

# Domain
If you want to host code-gov-web on your own domain, you'll have to change these files:
  - code-gov-web/config/CNAME

# title
To change the title of the website change the `title` property in `code-gov-web/config/code-gov-config.json`

# twitter handle
You can add the handle for your twitter account.  This is used to generate the link for the Twitter icon in the top right of each page.  Update the handle property in `code-gov-web/config/code-gov-config.json`

# more soon
There's many other ways to customize code-gov-web.  More documentation coming soon!

# contact
If you have any questions, you can post an issue on GitHub or email us at code@gsa.gov
