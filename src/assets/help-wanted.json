      "description": "I like this project! It is similar to a11y.css but ANDI seems to have better navigation. Likely because ANDI is javascript and a11y is only css.\nThat being said, I think the 'installation' instructions could be simplified to just start with, copy/paste the snippet. This should work in any browser.\nIt would be nice if the snippet was in the github readme as well.",
