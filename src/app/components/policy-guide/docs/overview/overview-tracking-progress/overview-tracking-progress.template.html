<h1>Tracking Progress</h1>
<h1>OMB’s Assessment of Agency Progress</h1>
<p>Section 7.7 of the Federal Source Code Policy states that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Progress on agency implementation of this policy will be primarily assessed by OMB through an analysis of each agency’s internal Government repositories, public OSS repositories, and code inventories on <a href="http://Code.gov">Code.gov</a>, as well as data obtained through the quarterly Integrated Data Collection (IDC), quarterly PortfolioStat sessions, the IT Dashboard, and additional mechanisms […]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>OMB’s approach to measuring and assessing agency progress in meeting this policy’s requirements will evolve over time in response to a number of factors. Generally, however, OMB’s approach can be broken into two categories: (1) analysis of agencies’ enterprise code inventories and individual code repositories, and (2) cross analysis of that information against overall operational and financial data collected by OMB.</p>
<p>OMB will provide additional information about its assessment mechanisms over time and address frequently asked questions from agencies and the public.</p>
<h2><a id="Analysis_of_Each_Agencys_Custom_Code_10"></a>Analysis of Each Agency’s Custom Code</h2>
<p>OMB will regularly review each agency’s enterprise code inventory to ensure that the agency is satisfying the requirements of the Federal Source Code Policy. This review will include both the agency’s internal Government repositories and public OSS repositories to ensure that each agency’s enterprise code inventory is properly reflected on – and easily discoverable through – <a href="http://Code.gov">Code.gov</a>.</p>
<h2><a id="Analysis_of_Overall_Data_14"></a>Analysis of Overall Data</h2>
<p>OMB’s Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer will collect data on agency operations and finances through a number of existing mechanisms, including the quarterly PortfolioStat sessions and the quarterly Integrated Data Collection. Much of this data will be made available publicly on <a href="http://ITDashboard.gov">ITDashboard.gov</a>. OMB will use this data to better understand the overall impact of the Federal Source Code Policy and to draw insights about individual agencies.</p>
<h2><a id="Quarterly_Assessments_18"></a>Quarterly Assessments</h2>
<p>OMB’s Office of the Federal Chief Information Officer will assess each agency’s performance at least once every quarter. These assessments will take place over the phone or in person and will provide agencies with a detailed overview of how well they are satisfying the requirements of the Federal Source Code Policy. Agency performance will eventually be made available via a public dashboard on <a href="http://Code.gov">Code.gov</a>.</p>
