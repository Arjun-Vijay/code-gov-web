<h1><a id="Tools_and_Resources_0"></a>Tools and Resources</h1>
<p>Agencies can use this list to become more fluent in the open source marketplace, practices, and best practices inside and outside of government.</p>
<p>Important note: tools and resources here are not mandatory for agency use and are not endorsed.  The purpose of this page is to provide broader context for agencies and to provide perspective into the breadth of tools available.  Also importantly, this list doesn’t attempt to be exhaustive on any topic; new tools are constantly being developed and practices are constantly evolving.</p>
<h2><a id="Source_Version_Control_7"></a>Source Version Control</h2>
<p>There are a number of robust, modern source version control systems available that may be appropriate to meet your agency’s needs. When selecting a platform agencies will want to consider a number of factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>does the platform provide the ability to develop in the open?</li>
<li>does your agency need both private and public repositories and does the platform allow seamless integration between the two?</li>
<li>is the platform interoperable with the dominant open source standard, <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>? Interoperability with git is crucial to your agency’s ability to collaborate with other agencies and the open source community, to avoiding vendor lock-in down the road, and to your ability to cheaply onboard talented technologists.</li>
<li>if your agency plans robust engagement with the open source community it may want to consider the social features of the platform beyond version control. Does it provide features that will enhance the ability of your agency to promote and share it’s code? How vibrant is the existing user community?</li>
</ul>
<p>Some platforms that agencies may want to take a look at based on their functionality and adoption by the open source community include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com">Github</a></li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com">Gitlab</a></li>
<li><a href="https://bitbucket.org">Bitbucket</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="Code_quality_and_security_19"></a>Code quality and security</h2>
<p>A number of commercial and free tools exist that agencies can optionally use as part of their development and code publication process to dramatically lower the risk that inappropriate or insecure content is released as well as the cost of doing so.</p>
<p>Increasingly, these tools can be configured to reflect the specific security policies of your agency and can be integrated directly into your agency’s developer workflow, scanning code automatically whenever code is committed or pushed for passwords, keys, watchwords, and other potentially sensitive information.  Some tools also provide broader capabilities related to coding standards and quality, etc.  In developing it’s overall source code strategy, your agency may want to consider integrating these kinds of tools into your developer workflow, contractually require their use by vendors, or use them to assess the quality and security of deliverables prior to accepting receipt.</p>
<p>Tools to consider include:</p>

<h2><a id="Development_practices_for_government_30"></a>Development practices for government</h2>
<p>A number of communities of practice exist that agency practitioners can use to keep abreast of open source inside and outside of government, to raise questions, and to share their experiences.</p>
