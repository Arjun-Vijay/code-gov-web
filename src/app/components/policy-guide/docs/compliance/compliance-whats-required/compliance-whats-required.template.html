<h1><a id="Overview__Whats_Required_2"></a>Overview - Whatâ€™s Required?</h1>
<p>The Federal Source Code Policy was issued on August 8, 2016 and requires both agencies and OMB to take specific actions within 90 and 120 days, as well as on an ongoing basis. This section of <a href="http://Code.gov">Code.gov</a> is designed to help agencies understand what is required by the policy and when those requirements kick in. Agencies should treat the content here as purely advisory and rely primarily on the text of the policy to satisfy their obligations. If there is any inconsistency between the Federal Source Code Policy and the implementation advice that appears on <a href="http://Code.gov">Code.gov</a>, the text of the policy will prevail.</p>
<h2><a id="Milestone__90_Days_6"></a>Milestone - 90 Days</h2>
<p>November 6 will mark 90 days from the issuance of the policy. By November 6, the following must be accomplished:</p>
<ul>
<li>OMB must:</li>
<li>Launch <a href="http://Code.gov">Code.gov</a></li>
<li>Provide content on <a href="http://Code.gov">Code.gov</a> regarding:</li>
<li>How best to measure source code (5.1)</li>
<li>Advice on how agencies can strengthen internal capacity to efficiently and securely deliver OSS as part of regular operations (7.1)</li>
<li>Advice on existing code repositories and common third-party repository platforms that agencies can use to satisfy the requirements of this policy (7.4)</li>
<li>Advice on various open source licenses that agencies can use when releasing custom-developed code as OSS (7.5)</li>
<li>Insight into how agency implementation of this policy will be assessed by OMB (7.7)</li>
<li>Agencies must:
<ul>
<li>Develop an agency-wide policy that addresses the requirements of the Source Code Policy and correct or amend any policies that are inconsistent with the requirements of the Source Code Policy (7.6)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="Milestone__120_Days_19"></a>Milestone - 120 Days</h2>
<p>December 6 will mark 120 days from the issuance of the policy. By December 6, the following must be accomplished:</p>
<ul>
<li>OMB must:</li>
<li>Provide content on <a href="http://Code.gov">Code.gov</a> regarding:</li>
<li>Metrics to assess the impact of the pilot program (5.1)</li>
<li>Metadata schema to help agencies fill out their enterprise code inventories (7.2)</li>
<li>Agencies must:</li>
<li>Update their enterprise code inventories using the metadata schema provided by OMB (7.2)</li>
</ul>
<h1><a id="Day_121_and_onward_28"></a>Day 121 and onward</h1>
<p>After these initial deliverables have been met, OMB and agencies will work together to drive implementation and capacity building across the Executive Branch. Generally, agencies should plan to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update, refine, and expand their code inventories to promote government-wide sharing and reuse of code; and</li>
<li>Build their internal open source pipeline in order to efficiently develop and publish open source code as part of the pilot program.</li>
</ul>
